# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my CSES Problem Set solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various problems from the CSES Problem Set. The solutions are implemented in C++14.

## Problem Naming Convention

Each problem solution is named after the problem name in camelCase format. If the problem name contains spaces, they are removed and the words are concatenated in camelCase.

For example, if the problem name is "Two Knights", the solution file will be named `twoKnights.cpp`.

## Input Files

If a problem requires an input file, you will find it in the repository named after the problem name, followed by "_input.txt".

For example, if the problem name is "Apple Division", the input file will be named `appleDivision_input.txt`.

## Table of Contents

Below is a list of problems I've solved along with links to their respective solutions:

1. [Problem 1 - ProblemName](./problemName.cpp)
   - [Input File - problemName_input.txt](./problemName_input.txt)

2. [Problem 2 - AnotherProblem](./anotherProblem.cpp)
   - [Input File - anotherProblem_input.txt](./anotherProblem_input.txt)
